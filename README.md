#ShowHackathonPassword

This is a simple Windows 8 Metro style application in JavaScript.  It runs on the Release Preview of Windows 8, and possibly later versions.

The purpose of this app is to display a hidden password which can then be used to register for a hackathon.  To display
the password:

1. Install the Release Preview of Windows 8 from http://preview.windows.com.  Or, use a retail version of Windows 8 once it's released.
2. Download Visual Studio Express Edition from http://dev.windows.com.  It's free.
3. Download GitHub for Windows from http://windows.github.com.
4. Clone this repo.
5. Open `ShowEventPassword.sln` in Visual Studio.
6. Run it (hit F5).

Why is this app necessary?  In order to display the password, the user will need to have completed the above steps.
This ensures that people registering for the hackathon have mastered installing the OS and developer tools.
